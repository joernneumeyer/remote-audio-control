# remote audio control
A very simplistic, web-based remote audio control.
Clone/download this repository and run `npm start` to start it.
Next, visit the host machine via `<some-local-ip-address>:8081`.
Now you should see the remote control.
just use the slider and the volume will be adjusted on the host!
